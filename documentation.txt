Project Documentation: Credit Card Fraud Detection Pipeline

Introduction
This documentation outlines the installation, execution, and benefits of the Credit Card Fraud Detection Pipeline developed by our company. The pipeline aims to build a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, leveraging various techniques such as exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment.

Installation
To install and execute the pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git


2.Navigate to the project directory:
cd credit-card-fraud-detection


3.Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Execution

Training the Model:

1.Open and run the Jupyter Notebook Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb to train the machine learning model.

2.Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Model Deployment:

1.Once the model is trained and saved, deploy it as an API using Flask.
2.Navigate to the api directory:
cd api
3.Run the Flask server:
python app.py
4.The Flask server should start running locally. Send POST requests to http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict with input data in JSON format to get predictions from the model.
